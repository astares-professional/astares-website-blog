# Archimate - Business

When creating a model with [archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) or other tools following the ArchiMate](https://www.opengroup.org/archimate-forum/archimate-overview) architecture approach you will model the business. Here are some tips on what I typically apply here:

## The Business section 

In ArchiMate, the **Business section** represents the **business layer** of an enterprise architecture model. 

Please do not get confused here if you have an IT background like me. Because in IT-Architecture the term "business layer" usually refers to the business logic within a (single) software system focusing on how data is processed and rules are applied. 

But in **Enterprise architecture** this has a much wider scope. It defines how an organization operates, gives insights into **business roles**, **functions**, **interactions**, and **services**. So the scope is very broad - more organization wide and on a strategic level.
