# Service Level Agreements (SLA) for Microsoft Online Services

Your business is relying on **cloud services from Microsoft** like 

- [M365](https://www.office.com)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)
- [Sharepoint Online](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration)
- [PowerBI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi)
- [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/)

and other to name just a few.

For regulatory reasons you have to stand an audit and provde compliance, service performance, or other contractual obligations. Then check the **SLA site** from Microsoft providing you the necessary documents for the Microsoft services:
