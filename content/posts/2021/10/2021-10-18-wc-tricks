# WordCount (wc) 

*The wc (word count) command in Unix/Linux is a powerful utility 
used to count lines, words, and characters in a file or text stream.*

## Basic usage

Running wc on a file gives a summary of its content

```bash
wc README.md
```
might result in
```
1047  6342 46120 README.md
```
which means 1047 Lines, 6342 Words and 46120 Characters in the file.

You can also do cherry picking to query for each info separately

### Prints the number of lines in a file.

```bash
wc -l README.md
```
results in
```
1047 README.md
```
### Prints the number of words in a file.
```bash
wc -w README.md
```
results in
```
6342 README.md
```
### Prints the number of characters (bytes) in a file.
```bash
wc -c README.md
```
results in
```
46120 README.md
```
### Improve the output

As you might have noticed the name of the file is included in the output. But often
you are only interested in the number. So lets combine it with *awk* command:

```bash
wc -c README.md | awk '{print $1}'
```
results in
```
46120
```
only


## Other Tricks

### Prints only the length of the longest line in a file.

```bash
wc -L file.txt
```
