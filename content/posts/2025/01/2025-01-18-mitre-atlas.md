# MITRE Atlas

I already mentioned the [MITRE ATT&CK Security Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/) here that one can use to understand attack vectors from the outside to own IT infrastructure and services. 

Now 2025 becomes the **year of AI** and many companies try to catch up with building or using AI services. While most people start with [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/), [Claude](https://claude.ai/) or [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), the more advanced users already start downloading and using custom made models from sites like [https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/) or use 

Like any other systems also AI bears a risk - cybercriminals have started finding ways to manipulate and deceive AI models as well. 

Within IT it would be good to have a better understanding of these risks and again MITRE helps with a comprehensive knowledge base that helps to understand adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures, typically known as TTP's. 

It is worth a look:

[https://atlas.mitre.org/matrices/ATLAS](https://atlas.mitre.org/matrices/ATLAS)

and compared to the [MITRE ATT&CK Security Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/) it is focused on **threats specific to AI systems**.
