# MITRE ATT&CK matrix

*Cyber threats are evolving at an alarming rate. If you work with exposed web systems you need a good understanding of attackersâ€™ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).*

## The resource

The **MITRE ATT&CK matrix** is like a big cheat sheet - it helps good guys to figure out how the bad guys (hackers) break into computers, steal information, or cause trouble. Initially provided by MITRE Corporation it evolved into a widely adopted cybersecurity standard.

It is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary **tactics** (grouped in columns) and **techniques** (matrix cells) based on real-world observations.

You can access the tool on

[https://attack.mitre.org/](https://attack.mitre.org)

and it is worth a look.

If you know these tricks, you can build better defenses.
