# Archimate - Motivations

## Archimate

*[ArchiMate](https://www.opengroup.org/archimate-forum/archimate-overview), as an open standard modeling language for enterprise architecture. It provides a structured way to define why an organization makes certain choices, aligning business objectives with architectural decisions.*

## Motivations

In the world of **enterprise architecture**, understanding the 

- **(business) goals** 
- **stakeholders**
- **drivers** behind strategic decisions 

is crucial. However, you also need to be aware of as these can be 

- **requirements** as well
- as **constraints** and other

a limiting factor. This is where **Motivations** in ArchiMate come into play. 

If you also use [archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) - to visualize and analyze systems following the [ArchiMate](https://www.opengroup.org/archimate-forum/archimate-overview) approach, then you might typically want to follow a few of my patterns that I will outline here:

### Requirements

A **requirement** (seen from a formal perspective) is a specific condition or capability that a system, process, or product must fulfill to meet **stakeholder** needs. For sure detailed requirements always depends on the business environment that you want to model. But there are certain requirements that are very common and as many companies approach a digital transformation, are related to IT systems.

Therefore in the predefined **Motivation** section I usually create a folder "*Requirements*" with another subfolder "*Common*"

![Motivations](../images/motivations.png)

Here you can define entries of type **"Requirement"** and here is my common list of standard requirements that might fit very well also in your models:

| Requirement       | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Availability     | System uptime and readiness. |
| Compliance      | Adherence to laws, regulations, and standards. |
| Efficiency      | Optimal use of resources|
| Fault Tolerance | Ability to continue functioning despite failures. |
| Flexibility     | Ability to adapt to changing requirements. |
| Interoperability | Ability to work with other systems and technologies. Enabling compatibility and integration with other systems. |
| Maintainability | Ease of maintenance and updates. Facilitating ease of updates, debugging, and long-term support. |
| Manageability   | How easy it is to manage resources. |
| Performance     | Speed, responsiveness, and latency. Defining acceptable levels of speed, scalability, and efficiency. |
| Portability     | Ease of moving the system to different environments. |
| Recoverability  | Speed and ease of recovery after a failure. |
| Reliability     | Consistency and dependability in performance. Addressing uptime, fault tolerance, and recovery mechanisms. |
| Scalability     | Ability to handle increased load and expand capacity. Ensuring the solution can grow in scope or capacity over time. |
| Security        | Protection against unauthorized access and data breaches. |
| Usability       | User-friendliness and ease of use. |

These requirements are **very generic** and can apply to **products and services**. If you want to model more IT specific needs you can for sure adopt. 

For instance when you **model cloud environments** you might want to describe some items more specific

| Requirement       | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
|Efficiency|Optimal use of resources in terms of CPU, memory, and bandwidth|

or add other Requirements like "Sustainability".

### Regulatory

Any business has to follow laws, rules, and guidelines that companies must comply with to operate legally and ethically. 

To reflect them in my model I typically create another folder in the  **Motivation** section called "Regulatory" where I can create specific subitems.

I typically model them by using the **driver** stereotype. When it comes to IT systems then **"Data Protection & Privacy"** plays a big role - so you might want to add regulatory items like [**GDPR**](https://gdpr-info.eu/)here.

![Regulatory](../images/regulatory.png)

If you work in insurance industry like me then [DORA](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en) might apply to your model as well. 

If your business has to follow **"Health & Safety Regulations"** like [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) or **"Environmental regulations"** like the *[EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation and Directive (PPWR and PPWD)](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/packaging-waste_en)* then these regulations should be mentioned here as well.

### Drivers

While regulations can be a driver, you might want to have an own folder for more specific drivers. A drivers represent an external or internal force that influence an organization's direction, decisions, and architecture.

- Customer Demand
- Market Trends
- Economic Conditions
- Corporate Strategy & Vision
- Technology Advancements

Following the [ArchiSurance case study](https://www.claydesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ArchiTool-Case-Study.pdf) you might wantt to model drivers like

 - Customer satisfaction
 - Stakeholder Satisfation
 - Profitability
 - Sales Target
 
 and other here.

### Stakeholders

Typical stakeholders include:

| Stakeholder                 | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Board                      | The group of directors responsible for corporate governance, decision-making, and overseeing the organizationâ€™s strategic direction. |
| Community & Social Groups  | Local communities affected by business operations or corporate social responsibility initiatives. |
| Competitors                | While not directly influencing internal decisions, market competition impacts strategic direction. |
| Customer                   | Individuals or businesses that purchase products or services, influencing company priorities based on their needs, expectations, and feedback. |
| Employees                  | Internal staff affected by organizational strategies and changes. |
| Media & Public Relations   | Influence brand reputation and public perception. |
| Partners                   | External business entities collaborating on projects, services, or supply chains. |
| Regulators                 | Government or industry bodies enforcing compliance and policies (e.g., financial authorities, data protection agencies). |
| Shareholders               | Investors interested in the financial health and strategic direction of the organization. |
| Suppliers                  | Vendors providing essential goods or services. |

### Goals

When it comes to strategic business goals I think you need to model three important aspects that you will find in most companies:

- Boost Revenue Growth
- Increase Market Share
- Cost reduction

but there might also be some IT specific goals like

- Modernize IT Infrastructure
- Enable Digital Transformation
- Improve System Reliability
- Enhance Cybersecurity

or Social Responsibility and Sustainability Goals like 

- Support Diversity & Inclusion
- Reduce Carbon Footprint
